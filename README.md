# Setup MVC Backend

## Overview

**Setup MVC Backend** is a CLI tool that generates a boilerplate structure for a Model-View-Controller (MVC) backend using Node.js and Express. This package is designed to streamline the development process for creating robust and scalable backend applications.

## Features

- **CLI Tool**: Instantly generate an MVC backend structure with a single command.
- **File Structure**: Includes predefined directories for models, views, controllers, and routes.
- **Dependencies**: Automatically sets up essential npm packages like `express` and `mongoose`.
- **Scalable Design**: Built to facilitate the development of scalable and maintainable applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Fast web framework for Node.js to build APIs.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

## Installation

To install the package globally, run:

```bash
{npm install -g git+https://github.com/vineetComfygen/node-starter-npmPackage1.git}

Usage
Create a New Project Directory:

```bash
Copy code
mkdir my-mvc-backend
cd my-mvc-backend
Run the CLI Command:

bash
Copy code
